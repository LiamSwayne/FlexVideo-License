In this document, the term "video" refers to any visual recording or broadcast. The term "this video" refers to video to which this license has been applied.

Express permission is granted to all to download, copy, and modify this video for personal use.

Protections applying to all forms of use:
1. This video can be reuploaded to its original platform and others if and only if the original video is no longer accessible. Reuploads are permitted on archival platforms at any time.
   1. This restriction only applies when the cumulative duration of distinct segments, excluding any overlap, used in the reupload exceeds 15 seconds.
2. Derivative videos (including but not limited to reaction and compilation content) must adhere to these restrictions:
   1. If the cumulative duration of distinct segments from this video, excluding any overlap, that are played in a derivative video surpasses 15 seconds, the time allocated to discussion of this video in the derivative video must be greater than the time dedicated to playing segments from this video. This protection is still upheld if this video is not the primary subject of the derivative video.
      1. Meaningful verbal comments qualify as discussion.
      2. Facial expressions without verbal comments do not qualify as discussion. Examples include nodding or shaking of the head.
      3. Facial expressions with verbal comments lacking substantial meaning do not qualify as discussion. This includes isolated filler words such as "um" and "mhm".
      4. Discussion overlapping with time spent playing this video counts towards both the cumulative duration of distinct segments played and time spent on discussion.
   2. If the cumulative duration of distinct segments from this video, excluding any overlap, that are played in a derivative video surpasses 60 seconds, the derivative video's description must provide a link to either the original video or a copy of the original that has been posted to an archival platform.
      1. If the platform where the derivative video is posted does not allow descriptions to be added to videos, the link must be made the primary focus of the video in a readable typeface for at least 1 second.

These guidelines may be bypassed if and only if given express permission by this video's rights-holder. If these guidelines are bypassed without express permission from this video's rights-holder, the rights-holder may take down or claim all revenue of a violating reupload or derivative video.
